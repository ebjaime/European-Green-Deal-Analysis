# Is the Green Deal Feasible?
## An analysis of the European Renewable Transition

During the last few decades, the European Union has made several proposals to stimulate the creation of
clean energy inside its country members (Kyoto protocol, Paris Agreement, European Green Deal, Clean
Energy for all Europeans, 2030 Climate and Energy EU objectives…) with the common objective of having a
total renewable energy future. Several projects have been carried out trying to predict whether these
objectives are plausible in the near future. A nonparametric approach seemed us like an interesting path
which could help analyze the effort made regarding this cause since it permits to obtain consistent
results under few conditions. We focused our attention on the European Green Deal (2020) that European
Commission President Ursula von der Leyen considered “like man landing on the moon” for Europe. In
fact this pact would make Europe the first continent to achieve Climate Neutrality by 2050 and in
particular it enhances Paris objective with the new target of 55% cut of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030
respect to 1990. Given the great importance for Europe that this pact would have if it were respected we
have set ourselves the goal of predicting whether this Green Deal target of a 55% cut in greenhouse gas
emissions (Ghg) by 2030 respect to 1990 levels is feasible. To do so we analyzed the European renewable
transition and forecasted future renewable energies and Ghg values, taking advantage of current and
past knowledge of data about production, consumptions and greenhouse gases. Since all energy related
information for every EU member is open to the public in the EU’s Eurostat portal, and all of its datasets
contain clean and reliable information, we deemed this project very interesting and useful to draw
further attention to these issues while using the nonparametric techniques learnt. We worked on a
variety of time series datasets about European energy consumption and of Ghg emissions in the time
window from 1990 to the present (see References). To properly predict future renewable energy and Ghg
values and to make our models more robust we also used population and Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) reliable predictions (see References).
